# How to get started

<details><summary>Is this the first time you use a GitHub Classroom Assignment from docs.kea.dev?</summary>

After you have accepted the assignment in GitHub Classroom, you will need to initialize it by importing the issues from the template.

- Open a GitHub CodeSpace 
- From the terminal - with the repository roost as the working directory - run:
  ```
  .github/template/cpissues.sh
  ```

The command will create a series of issues in your own repo - simply get cracking at 'em - work those issues!
